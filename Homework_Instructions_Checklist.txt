1. Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called `topics`.
   * We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.

2. Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.
   * Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

   - create html page with bootstrap for layout- done
   - link all files and do styling - done
   - create github repo for project and do first commit- done
   - troubleshoot stylesheets- caught that I had bootstrap styles overriding my customtheme and fixed the link order - done
   - finalize non-javascript files - done
   - write js code to create buttons from array and successfully test - done

3. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
    - pseudocode this part
    - actually code the sections of this part- url and AJAX call
